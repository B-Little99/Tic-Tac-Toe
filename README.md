This is a Tic Tac Toe multiplayer game.

It should be able to place X's and O's depending on what user you play as. When you win the winning positions should increase size and turn red, with accompanying text to indicate someone has won.

During this process I developed my understanding of array methods as I used Array.from and .foreach methods when checking for any wins once a player has placed an X or O.

I used a number of functions, event listeners and DOM manipulation techniques to help me achieve the goal.
